# Cat as a Service

Cat as a Service is a mobile application that uses the Cat as a Service REST API to spread peace and love (or not) thanks to cats!

## How It Works

You can request a photo of a random cat, a photo of a cat by its id, or you can search by a specific tag! You can also personalize the requested cat, giving him something to say, a filter, and add some color to the text! (NOTE: I think adding color to the text isn't working in this version of the API)
You can also save the cat you just recieved locally in your files!

## Architecture
